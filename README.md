This **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game is a Python-based GUI application that allows you to play the classic game against the computer. The game is built using **Tkinter**, Python’s standard library for creating graphical user interfaces.

### Key Features:

1. **Game Mechanics**: The user selects one of the options (Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, or Scissors ✂️) by clicking on a button. The computer randomly picks one as well, and the winner is determined based on the traditional rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
   - If both selections are the same, it's a tie.

2. **Color-Coded Feedback**: The result of each round is displayed in a color-coded label:
   - **Green** for a win.
   - **Red** for a loss.
   - **Orange** for a tie.

3. **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the number of wins for both the user and the computer, updating the score after each round.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The app uses symbols (🪨, 📄, ✂️) next to the text on buttons and display labels, which makes it visually intuitive for players.

5. **Aesthetic Design**: The GUI uses modern styling, including a dark theme with a clean, simple layout and stylish buttons. The text color and button designs are adjusted for a more pleasant user experience.

This game provides a good introduction to GUI development, randomization, and basic game logic in Python. It’s interactive, visually appealing, and fun to play!
